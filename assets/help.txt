AirGuard is a real-world intrusion detection system based around the detection of Wi-Fi packets from mobile devices.

In a standard scenario, this can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or some other small computer tucked away on your
property, and after building a list of recognized MAC addresses, it will begin monitoring the airwaves. If it detects
a MAC address that is not in the list, it will send an alert or run a script (every 60 seconds if the MAC address
continues to be seen). Right now, AirGuard is only 2.4 GHz capable, since most devices are rather chatty on that band.

To start, use --build to begin creating a list of all nearby devices seen. It will automatically authorize any devices
(including Wi-Fi access points) in range, so be sure that you're the only one nearby. If you live in a congested area,
you may want to consider narrowing your range by bringing --dbm closer to zero (default -50). Once you've got all your
devices in the list, stop AirGuard then restart it without the --build flag. It should begin showing alerts for any
devices detected that are not in the list. You can run a --script when these detections occur to notify you. If a device
is consistent, you will only get 1 alert/log/execution per minute for that particular device.

Usage:
    java -jar AirGuard.jar --interface <interface> --list <trusted_mac_list> <options>

Examples:
    java -jar AirGuard.jar -i wlo1mon -l /var/knownMACs.txt
    java -jar AirGuard.jar -i wlo1mon -l /var/knownMACS.txt --script /usr/local/share/alertTheAdmin.py
    java -jar AirGuard.jar -i wlo1mon -l /var/knownMACS.txt --log /var/log/airguard.log --script /usr/local/share/scripts/alertTheAdmin.py
    java -jar AirGuard.jar -i wlo1mon -l /var/knownMACS.txt --dbm -30 -b

Options:
    -h, --help          Displays this handy dandy help file!
    -v, --version       Displays program version info
    -i, --interface <>  The promiscuous interface to monitor (required)
    -l, --list <>       The list of trusted device addresses to ignore (required)
    -b, --build         Switches the program into "builder" mode where it adds all nearby devices to a new
                        trusted MAC list, specified by --list
    -d, --dbm <>        The signal strength threshold that devices must be within to be detected (default -50 dBm is usually fine)
    --log <>            The file path to log alien devices
    --script <>         The script to run when an alien device is detected. The unrecognized MAC is passed as an argument to the script
